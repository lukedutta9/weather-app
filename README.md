# weather-app

This is a basic weather app that shows the current weather of any city that the person inputs, with added information about temperatures, humidity, and pressure. It was a lot of fun making the app, I got to learn a lot about designing a website with HTML and CSS and processing data through Javascript.

Some extra things I want to add to this weather app:
- [ ] Proper spell checking for the city input
- [ ] Proper error handling for bad API requests
- [ ] Add the ability to pick Fahrenheit or Celsius for the temperatures
- [ ] Add in some cool animations and fade ins

Oh by the way, to use the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) that I used in this app, you need an access token from them (which requires making an account). What I did was create another file not on the repo (for me called config.js) that held my key, which I could use in the main js application. If you want to try running this, you need to replace that access token variable with your key.
